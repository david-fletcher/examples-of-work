These two files are part of my now published mobile application, SimpleTimer (on GooglePlay, created by FletchApps). One is the XML layout definition for the main activity, and the other is the Java that sits behind the UI to allow the user to interact with the various UI elements. Both were written solely by me as a final project for a mobile development course. There are many files beyond these that make up the entire project.
